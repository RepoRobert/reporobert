While you're in the safety and comfort of the corporate world, working a normal 9-to-5 job, you might not need to think much about marketing as a software developer, but once you try to go "freelance" (I really hate that word) you'll spend on about 50% of your time coding. The rest will be spend on business operations: finding clients, creating content for social media to attract leads, communicating with clients. I don't like the term "freelance" because you should not spend much time in this solo state. You need a team.

Later I'll write a post about how to find co-founders for your business.
