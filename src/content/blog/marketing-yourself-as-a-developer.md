While you're in the safety and comfort of the corporate world, working a normal "9 to 5" job, you might not need to think much about marketing yourself as a software developer beyond acing interviews to get a job, but once you try to go "freelance" (I really hate that word) you'll spend only about 50% of your time coding. The rest will be spent on business operations: creating content on social media to attract leads, screening clients, and communicating project progress.

I don't like the term "freelance" because you should not spend much time in this solo state. You need a team. Later I'll write a post about how to find co-founders for your business so you can scale beyond a job you created for yourself toward an asset you own ðŸ“ˆ

Anyway, does this Spotify embed work?
