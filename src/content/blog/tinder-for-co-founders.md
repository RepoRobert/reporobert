A few sites come up if you google "find a cofounder":

- https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching
- https://cofounderslab.com/
- https://www.founderio.com/
- https://www.starthawk.io/find-a-co-founder

Personally, I'm interested in local, Lithuanian "matchmaking." I've spent little time looking for the best platforms, but there are options out there.

For general networking, LinkedIn has the most people on it, but from my experience, you'll find yourself engaging with LinkedIn marketers and "growth hackers." Their business mindset is set in stone.

To really get to know the people you're building a business with you need to go through tough times. It's true for any relationship, but especially for co-founders who will often find themselves in high stress situations that they'll have to deal with together.

Your best bet is to get good at pattern recognition, and learn from your "teaming up" mistakes. Take small bets, lean into fast, insightful, and iterative failure. A good eye for finding great teammates is not transferrable knowledge and it'll be more challenging than filtering out bad clients, as you'll need to filter out a lot more people.

It's harder to look for green flags than red ones.
